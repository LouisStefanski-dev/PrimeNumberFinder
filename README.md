# PrimeNumberFinder

This program is a simple test I did as I wondered how the percentage of prime numbers compared to nonprime numbers compared in arbitrarily large values. 

Outcome: This program shows that the percentage of prime to nonprime numbers is not a fixed ration and given a large enough data set will trend towards 0. Another useful finding was that the change in the ratio was not consistent from one prime to another.
